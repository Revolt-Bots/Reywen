# Reywen 
A general purpose bot running with an asynchronous 'plugin' system, built on the RevX2 library.
Written in funny crab language :crab:.

The processes in Reywen are split up into 'plugins' which can interact with Revolt via the API. Each plugin can be configured on runtime with no need to restart. There will be a 'how to make a plugin' section of the Wiki soon that will be easy to follow. ( If you can convince ToastXC that your plugin is worthy of being hosted on the main server they might add it to the stack >.> ).

### Things i won't add
- SQL support (just use mongodb)
- Discord integration
- Embed support
- Moderation features (outside of RevX2)


# Getting started
